# uPMT

uPMT is aimed at reserchers using explicitation or microphenomenological interviews to study lived experience. It has been designed to help analyze the micro-dynamics of experience as described in interview transcriptions, by modelling and formalizing the sequential unfolding of "experience moments" described with concepts and attributes. 

The first version of the software was implemented by Corentin Jezequel in late 2017, under the supervision of Yannick Pri√© and Thomas Rabeyron.
