# uPMT

uPMT is aimed at researchers using microphenomenology interviews (also know as explicitation interviews) to study lived experience. It has been designed to help analyze the micro-dynamics of experience as described in interview transcriptions, by modelling and formalizing the sequential unfolding of "experience moments" described with categories and properties, and linked to the descriptemes - excerpts of the transcript - that justify them.

Current work is carried out by Gwenaelle Gouriten, Salma Hichami,  Othman Houmair. The first version of the software was implemented by Corentin Jezequel in late 2017, under the supervision of Yannick Prié and Thomas Rabeyron. Version 0.1 to 0.3 were implemented by Mehdi Haddad, with the help of Eva Boon and Yinxing Huang, under the supervision of Yannick Prié.
